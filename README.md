I am Kellye, and I have worked in tech for the last 12 years. I've lead teams that build open source platforms in the cloud for government, media companies, healthcare and financial institutions. I'm currently the Core Innovation portfolio lead for at Capital One. My career goals are to modernize financial systems so that money and welath becomes easier, cheaper, more accessible and more available to everyone in the world equally. I choose FinTech because I believe that emerging technologies will help me realize my vision of financial empowerment for all.
